## The development trending of AMM projects

- reduce slippage
- block front-running
- enable order book's advantages like a limit order
- reduce gas fee
- block impermanent loss
- provide more yields to LP owners

## Comparing with DEX using order book

- There is always liquidity without a market maker
- It has big slippage for small liquidity of AMM
- They're both vulnerable to front-running
